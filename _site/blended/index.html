    <h2 class="post-header">Blended Workflow</h2>
    <p>The Blended Workflow project fuses an activity-based approach with a goal-based approach. Its environment allows end users to follow a standard pre-defined behaviour when performing their work (following an activity-based view), but to deviate whenever an unexpected situation occurs (following a goal-based view). The Blended Workflow engine is responsible to keep the two different views of any workflow instance synchronised so that end users can decide at any time which view to use to perform their work.</p>

<h1 id="protoptype">Protoptype</h1>

<p>A first prototype was developed on top of the <a href="http://www.yawlfoundation.org/">YAWL</a> activity-based engine. Currently, a second version of the prototype is being implemented, which take further the level of integration with YAWL. </p>

<p>A short demo of the second prototype is available here. The code is publicly available in a github repository: <a href="https://github.com/socialsoftware/blended-workflow">https://github.com/socialsoftware/blended-workflow</a>.</p>

<p>The formal proof of the consistent execution of a well-formed Blended Workflow specification.</p>

<h1 id="research-opportunities">Research Opportunities</h1>

<p>In the context of the Blended Workflow project, we have open full-time research opportunities for PhD and MSc studies, and part-time internships for students that want to develop research skills by working in an exciting and innovative project. If you are interested, please, contact the project coordinator.</p>

<p>The internships have a 30 hours duration and to apply for it a minimum set of competences is required: The students must master the concepts and technologies taught in the Software Engineering course.</p>

<p>Both, thesis and internships, address several existing open problems. The following, are some examples, but contact us to receive more detailed information about the current project status and needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>User interface development

<ul>
<li>Define and implement a user friendly interface for the modeling of a blended workflow specification</li>
<li>Define and design a user friend interface for the integrated execution of a blended workflow instance, according to both views: activity and goal</li>
<li>Define and develop small interface modules that improve the user interface usability, for instance:</li>
<li>Improve the interface flow</li>
<li>Simplify the data model presentation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Blended workflow engine

<ul>
<li>Enhance the worklist manager module to support an organisational structure</li>
<li>Define and develop additional modules to be integrate with the core blended workflow modules, for instance:</li>
<li>Implement a logging module</li>
<li>Implement a recommendation module</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
