    <h2 class="post-header">Blended Workflow</h2>
    <p>The Blended Workflow project fuses an activity-based approach with a goal-based approach. Its environment allows end users to follow a standard pre-defined behaviour when performing their work (following an activity-based view), but to deviate whenever an unexpected situation occurs (following a goal-based view). The Blended Workflow engine is responsible to keep the two different views of any workflow instance synchronised so that end users can decide at any time which view to use to perform their work.</p>

<h1 id="protoptype">Protoptype</h1>

<p>We are developping a prototype that includes a designer of well-formed blended workflow models and a blended workflow execution engine. The code is publicly available in a github repository: <a href="https://github.com/socialsoftware/blended-workflow">https://github.com/socialsoftware/blended-workflow</a>.</p>

<p>A first prototype of a blended workflow execution engine was developed on top of the <a href="http://www.yawlfoundation.org/">YAWL</a> engine and it is available in tag <a href="https://github.com/socialsoftware/blended-workflow/releases/tag/v1.0">v1.0</a>. A short demo of the first prototype is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Anb4kuXtBgc">here</a>. </p>

<li>Definition of a sound method to create well-formed Blended Workflow specifications.</li>
<li>The formal proof of the consistent execution of a well-formed Blended Workflow specification.</li>
<li>The implemention of an integrated designer and executor.</li>

<h1 id="research-opportunities">Research Opportunities</h1>

<p>In the context of the Blended Workflow project, we have open full-time research opportunities for PhD and MSc studies, and part-time internships for students that want to develop research skills by working in an exciting and innovative project. If you are interested, please, contact the project coordinator.</p>

<p>The internships have a 30 hours duration and to apply for it a minimum set of competences is required: The students must master the concepts and technologies taught in the Software Engineering course.</p>

<p>Both, thesis and internships, address several existing open problems. The following, are some examples, but contact us to receive more detailed information about the current project status and needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blended workflow engine

<ul>
<li>Introduce the organisational perspective and the correspond work assigments to the Blended Workflow designer and executor</li>
<li>Introduce the access control perspective to the Blended Workflow designer and executor</li>
<li>Study several dimensions of flexibility in the Blended Workflow executor</li>
<li>Develop a module for workflow logging and allow to replay it by using a event source architecture</li>
</ul></li>
<li>User interface development

<ul>
<li>Define and implement a user friendly interface for the modeling of a blended workflow specification</li>
<li>Define and design a user friend interface for the integrated execution of a blended workflow instance, according to both views: activity and goal</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
